# Call Attacks Exercise 2

## Intro
In the bustling city of Technopolis, a renowned company named "SecureStore Inc." offered storage solutions for a wide range of clients. SecureStore's warehouse had become a popular choice for individuals, as they offered flexible rental periods and easy access.

As technology evolved, SecureStore decided to shift their warehouse access management system to a blockchain-based solution, ensuring greater transparency and accountability for their clients. Their customers could rent a warehouse for as long as they needed, and they were even allowed to claim a refund if they decided to leave early.

This innovative approach attracted a large number of users and SecureStore has received countless payments in USDC. However, they failed to implement adequate security measures to protect their digital assets.

Can you find the vulnerability and steal all the funds from the SecureStore?
